    3. pannels consist of action buttons
        + Next
        + Back
        + Submit
        + Confirm
    4. pannles will take heading actions and the body
    5. File name for the new Game config is GameConfigPannles.jsx


Notes:
    1. I am using Portal to render the menu on the top of the screen
    2. Installed Portal to render the menu on the top of the screen and to prevent menu overflow from the screen

What i was doing:
    1. I wanted the body of modal pannel to be felxible and let the component decide where it has to be placed. If it should on top or centered
    2. also considering the Responsvieness in different screens
    3. we need to remove the CricketCofigForm.module.css beacuse it just not requrie and comes in middle of component and the parent making hard 

Finished:
    1. Coin Flip
    2. Picking Bat or Bowling

Today:
    1. Selct Player
    2. use Framer Motion for the toggle button
